# STEGNOGRAPHY_PROJECT
Steganography is the art of hiding information within ordinary files like images, audio, or videos, making it invisible to the naked eye. This project uses Python to implement steganography techniques, allowing users to securely embed and extract secret messages or files within digital media.
